# Sourcemapper

Sourcemapper is a bit of golang to parse a sourcemap, as generated by webpack or similar, and spit out the original JavaScript files, recreating the source tree based on the file paths in the sourcemap.

An article explaining its purpose is available here: [https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/articles/javascript-from-sourcemaps](https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/articles/javascript-from-sourcemaps)

## Usage

```None
:~$ ./sourcemapper
Usage of ./sourcemapper:
  -help
        Show help
  -output string
        Source file output directory
  -input string
        path to the Sourcemap file
```

Sourcemapper will download the map file at `url`, and then spit the sources out into the directory defined by `output`

### For MacOS

Binary: `isourcemapper`

## Limitations

Paths such as 'webpack:/~/src/whatever/omg.js' are pretty common, so this tool will likely fail on NTFS file systems. EXT4 works fine though :D
